        roles.

        If you are creating a mapping table for an entity defined in another
        service.xml, you need to specify the full package path.

        <!--
        The id-type and id-param values are used in order to create an auto-generated,
        auto-incrementing primary key when inserting records into a table. This can be
        implemented in 4 different ways, depending on the type of database being used.
        In all cases, the primary key of the model object should be assigned a value of
        null, and Hibernate will know to replace the null value with an auto-generated,
        auto-incremented value. If no id-type value is used, it is assumed that the
        primary key will be assigned and not auto-generated.

        The first implementation uses a class to generate a primary key.

        For example:

        <column
            name="id"
            type="Integer"
            primary="true"
            id-type="class"
            id-param="com.liferay.counter.service.persistence.IDGenerator"
        />

        In this implementation, the class specified in the id-param value will be called
        to retrieve a unique identifier (in the example above, an Integer) that will be
        used as the primary key for the new record. This implementation works for all
        supported databases.

        The second implementation generates identifiers that are unique only when no
        other process is inserting data into the same table. This implementation should
        NOT be used in a clustered environment, but it does work for all supported
        databases.

        For example:

        <column
            name="id"
            type="Integer"
            primary="true"
            id-type="increment"
        />

        The third implementation uses an identity column to generate a primary key.

        For example:

        <column
            name="id"
            type="Integer"
            primary="true"
            id-type="identity"
        />

        In this implementation, the create table SQL generated for this entity will
        create an identity column that natively auto-generates a primary key whenever
        an insert occurs. This implementation is only supported by DB2, MySQL, and
        MS SQL Server.

        The fourth implementation uses a sequence to generate a primary key.

        For example:

        <column
            name="id"
            type="Integer"
            primary="true"
            id-type="sequence"
            id-param="id_sequence"
        />

        In this implementation, a create sequence SQL statement is created based on
        the id-param value (stored in /sql/sequences.sql). This sequence is then
        accessed to generate a unique identifier whenever an insert occurs. This
        implementation is only supported by DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SAP DB.
